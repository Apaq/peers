peers
=====

This used to just be a clean fork of http://peers.sourceforge.net/ (also at https://github.com/ymartineau/peers).

Over time Peers just became too inflected by Java Applet code - even in the core. Also the use of a homebrewed Logging framework required carrying a Logger instance in every Constructor. Furthermore we wanted a more clean API.

All in all; In the end we decided to not make pull-requests towards the original repo, but instead go our seperate way as we just needed a clean SIP client API.
